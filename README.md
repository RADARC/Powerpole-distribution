# Powerpole-distribution
Anderson Powerpole distribution board with reverse polarity and over voltage protection.
Designed primarily for amateur radio use.

4 outputs rated at 30A with a combined 30A rating.
TVS diodes to dissipate any transient voltage spikes.
SCR based crowbar circuit for over voltage protection.
Latching relay to disconnect supply if the crowbar cuircuit triggers as the input fuse may take time to blow depending on the available current from the supply.
Diode protection around the relay and enable switch to stop the output from being enabled if the polarity is reversed.
Input fuse for added protection.
Output fuses to protect devices which may be rated at lower currents.
